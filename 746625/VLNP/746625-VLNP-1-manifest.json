The female was aroused while the scan of the center portion was made, and immediately after the scan an orgasm was induced and the scan for the outer half was made.  </p> <p>This compound model shows how, at least in this person, the vulva swells up in a state of arousal and then returns to its usual condition once the arousal abates.</p>"
