During the scan of the left side the person was not aroused, and during the scan of the right side the person was aroused. You can see how the texture of the skin has changed between the not aroused and aroused state.  </p> <p> This compound model shows how, at least in this person, the vulva swells up in a state of arousal and then returns to its usual condition once the arousal abates.</p>"
