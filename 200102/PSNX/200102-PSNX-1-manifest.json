    "comment": " <p> <b>This model is heavily modified!</b> </p> <p> Making an erect penis model is a complicated process because the software we use to make 3D models from photos is very sensitive to movement. However, humans are constantly moving via breathing, heartbeats and other involuntary movements. Holding a pose in an uncomfortable situation for 45 seconds without breathing is challenging for the model and even with the best efforts this causes most 3D model creation process to fail.</p> <p> This model has been constructed from 3 separate scans, and the top was especially difficult to reconstruct. The tip of the penis is the point that has the greatest amount of movement, making it near impossible to get a scan without movement at all. We had to do a lot of manual post processing to create an acceptable model.  </p> <p> <b>Release note:</b> </p> <p> This is the first working scan of an erect penis that we were able to create.  We thank all the human models who allowed us to do test shootings, for their patience, dedication and the courage to try this!  </p>",
